      "description": "Reducing Non-Revenue Water (NRW) loss is crucial for ensuring sustainable water management in Kisumu. During our productive discussion with Kisumu Water and Sanitation Company Limited (KIWASCO), we explored how Parliament can play an active role in addressing the 38% NRW loss through legislative frameworks, policy oversight, and budget allocations for infrastructure improvements. Key areas of focus include upgrading aging pipelines, improving metering systems, and leveraging technology such as smart water monitoring to detect and prevent leakages. Collaboration with water service providers is essential in strengthening governance, enhancing service delivery, and promoting accountability in water distribution.",
